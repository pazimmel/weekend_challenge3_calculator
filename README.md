# weekend_challenge3_calculator
This weekend project involved creating a calculator as a way to practice using ajax server calls,
modules, and responses from the server. The numbers to be calculated should be inputed client side on the DOM;
the calculation should be done server side before being sent back to the client to be displayed on the DOM.

Strech goals of the project were to make it look more like an actual calculator in terms of display and functionality.
